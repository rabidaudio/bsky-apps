            <h1>List Feed</h1>
            
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
            <p>
                Sometimes you want to see only posts from certain people, for example a group of close friends
                or an organization.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Eventually Bluesky will likely add support for feeds based on lists, but currently lists are only used
                for mutes.
                In the meantime, You could create your own feed with your own hard-coded list of people to follow.
                But this sucks for two reasons. First it's a lot of work. And second, your feed would be public, so
                anyone could see who was on your list. That's something you might not want if you're making a feed
                for your secret crushes or nemeses or whatever.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This app allows you to create lists that are unique to you. It works like this:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>You log in to this site using a BSky app password (see below)</li>
                <li>
                    You create your list(s) here on this site. There are 4 public list slots ("List 1", "List 2", etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                    You subscribe to the Feed(s). The feeds are public, but will lookup your personal list for that slot
                    and show you those posts. Other people will see their own "List X" posts on their feed. If you don't
                    create the list beforehand on this site, the feed will be empty.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Current Limitations</h3>
            
            <p>
                This is a pretty quick-and-dirty project. If any of these limitations are an issue for you, reach out with your
                use-case and I'll see what can be done.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>There are 4 list slots</li>
                <li>Lists are limited to 250 members</li>
                <li>Only the last 48 hours worth of posts are available through the feed</li>
            </ul>
